# React + Vite (Mini Project 2 - Dibimbing.id)

Version: 1.0.0

## Description

This project is the second assignment from the Front-End Web Development Bootcamp at Dibimbing.id, utilizing the React + Vite framework. The project incorporates JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with the use of SVG and PNG features to display images or icons. Additionally, it implements a responsive website design for various devices, including mobile, tablet, laptop, and 4k monitors. The completion of this project was slightly more complex and time-consuming compared to the previous one, which only required 4 days of work. For this project, I invested approximately 2 weeks, incorporating additional features beyond the scope of the bootcamp.
